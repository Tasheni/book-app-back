## About

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is the backend API for my personal reading tracker app. It's a cozy work in progress, built with Nest.js and MongoDB to help me keep tabs on my reading adventures.

## What it does (So far!)
Book Bliss: Add, update, or bid farewell to books in my reading realm.
Reading Progress: Log my reading progress because, well, who doesn't love tracking accomplishments?
Reading Sessions: Capture the essence of each reading session - when it began, when it ended, and everything in between.
Just for Me: It's my own little space, so no need to worry about user authentication.

## Tech Love
- Nest.js: Because building it had to be as enjoyable as reading a good book.
- MongoDB: My data sanctuary.

## Work in Progress ðŸš§
Just like a good book, this project is still unfolding. Feel free to peek, but mind the dust - it's still settling.

## Why Share?
Well, why not? Maybe someone else will find joy in their reading journey too!
